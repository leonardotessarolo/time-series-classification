# time-series-classification

Different experiments with time series classification.
 - Folder 1-rnn_random_vs_arma contains an experiment where the capabilities of an RNN model to recognize a correlation structure agains white noise are tested. Also, the relationship between the network's label 1 (class for ARMA processes) probabilities are analyzed against the AR and MA coefficients that spawned each sample ARMA process.
